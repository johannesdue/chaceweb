*Documenting Contemporary Antisemitism* is a research blog for CHACE (Comparing Histories of Antisemitism in Contemporary Europe), a project based at the [Norwegian Institute for Social Research](https://www.socialresearch.no) and the Center for Research on Extremism ([C-REX](https://www.sv.uio.no/c-rex/english/)) at the University of Oslo.

This site will be used to post documentation, [data](/chaceweb/data), and occasional reflections related to topics covered in the project.

# About CHACE

The project seeks to describe and explain the development of antisemitism in post-Cold War Europe (1990-2020) by way of comparative-historical case studies of selected countries as well as qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). We will try to answer two main questions:
* What characterizes the diverging paths of post-Cold War antisemitism in Europe?
* Why has antisemitism come to afflict some countries more than others, as demonstrated by the varying prevalence of anti-Jewish attitudes, different levels of violence and harassment targeting Jews, and variation in the levels of concern expressed by Jews?

CHACE is funded by the Research Council of Norway. Directing the project, and maintaining this site, is [Johannes Due Enstad](https://www.samfunnsforskning.no/english/people/res/johane/index.html), Senior Researcher at the Norwegian Institute for Social Research. Also participating in the project is [Zuzanna Roslonska](https://www.sv.uio.no/c-rex/english/people/aca/zuzannr/index.html), a doctoral research fellow at C-REX.
