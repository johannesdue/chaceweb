I have posted a draft paper to SocArXiv entitled "Contemporary Antisemitism in Three Dimensions: A New Framework for Analysis". 

Here is the abstract:

> What characterizes the development of antisemitism in the 21st century, and why does it affect some countries more than others? In order to begin answering this crucial question, this article proposes a new analytical framework composed of three key dimensions: antisemitic attitudes, incidents targeting Jews, and Jews’ exposure to antisemitism. Reviewing extant data on these indicators, the article finds that: (1) attitudes vary considerably by geographic and cultural region as well as among population sub-groups; (2) current incident data do not enable cross-national comparison, but global incident counts have fluctuated on a relatively high level after 2000; and (3) Jews’ exposure to antisemitism appears relatively high and stable over the past decade, with some notable temporal and spatial variation, and is not tied to levels of antisemitic attitudes in the way one might expect. Employing the three-dimensional framework enables the formation of a more accurate and nuanced picture of how antisemitism is developing, and helps identify unresolved questions and hypotheses to guide future research.
