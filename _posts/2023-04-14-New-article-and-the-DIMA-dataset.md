I am happy to announce a new publication, "Accounting for Contemporary Antisemitism: A Four-Dimensional Framework and a New Dataset", published in [*Antisemitism Studies*](https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/3/article/885991). An ungated preprint version can be downloaded at [SocArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/adqkn/).

This article introduces a new conceptual and empirical framework for studying patterns of antisemitism cross-nationally and over time, as well as a new dataset intended to complement the framework: DIMA (Dimensions of Antisemitism).

The DIMA dataset compiles longitudinal (from 1990 onward) and cross-national data that measure indicators relating to three core dimensions of antisemitism: attitudes, incidents, and Jews' exposure. DIMA is assembled from a variety of publicly available sources, including international attitude surveys, incident monitoring, and victimization surveys. It enables users to track and analyze patterns of antisemitism over time and across countries. DIMA will be updated regularly, incorporating new data to extend the time series.

We hope the DIMA dataset may become a useful tool for researchers, policymakers, journalists, and organizations interested in understanding the development of antisemitism. Users can leverage DIMA to identify and analyze trends and to generate or test research hypotheses.

The dataset is [hosted](https://www.sv.uio.no/c-rex/english/groups/dima-dataset/index.html) by the Center for Research on Extremism (C-REX) at the University of Oslo. The data can be also be accessed at [OSF](https://osf.io/x4vcj/).
