How is contemporary antisemitism developing globally and over time? A key step towards answering this question is to collect and inspect relevant data. As part of the CHACE project, publicly available data is being gathered from a range of sources, including cross-national attitude surveys, global incident monitoring, and victimization surveys. 

As a result of this work, I have created the DIMA (Dimensions of Antisemitism) dataset, which is publicly available at [OSF](https://osf.io/x4vcj/).

### Data visualization

Click on the links below to view interactive plots showing some key patterns and trends in the development of contemporary antisemitism. The plots were created in R using [Plotly](https://plotly.com/ggplot2/getting-started/).

- [Levels of concern among Jews in Europe]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/concern-levels.md %})

### Qualitative data

In addition to quantitative data on attitudes, incidents, and Jews' perceptions of antisemitism, CHACE also collects qualitative data, including interviews and reporting by news media and NGOs in the countries we study. These data are generally protected by privacy regulations and cannot be shared publicly. However, anonymized interview transcripts may be accessed upon closure of the research project.
