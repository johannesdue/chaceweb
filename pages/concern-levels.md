Exposure to antisemitism affects Jewish communities in various ways. The plots are based on data derived from two strong measures of the overall level of concern over antisemitism. The first shows the share of Jewish respondents in twelve EU countries saying safety concerns prompt them to *never* show their identity in public. The second plot shows the extent to which Jews say they have considered emigrating due to safety concerns related to their identity as Jews.
