Surveys can measure prejudice in various ways. Researchers can ask whether people think positively or negatively about the group in question, which provides a straightforward and easy-to-interpret measure. Another way is to have respondents select groups they would not like to have as neighbors (a social-distance measure of prejudice). Third, one may ask respondents to agree or disagree about particular statements deemed to reflect prejudice.

The following plots show the development of antisemitic attitudes over time and across countries based on cross-national surveys with nationally representative samples using each of the three measures.

The first plot is based on data from [Pew's global attitudes surveys](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/datasets/) reaching back to 1991. Values for each country-year were calculated by subtracting the share of respondents indicating an unfavorable opinion of Jews from the share indicating a favorable one.

The second plot was built using [World](https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSContents.jsp)/[European Values Survey](https://europeanvaluesstudy.eu/methodology-data-documentation/data-and-documentation/) data on rejection of Jews as neighbors from 1990 to 2020.

The third plot uses data from the Anti-Defamation League's (ADL) 2014 global survey of antisemitic attitudes covering 101 countries. The index score for each country is equal to the percentage of respondents answering "probably true" (the other choice being "probably false") to at least six out of eleven statements thought to reflect antisemitic prejudice (for details about the survey methodology, click [here](https://perma.cc/Z7HH-FUSF)).
