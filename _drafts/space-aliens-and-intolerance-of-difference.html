<p>A year ago, space watchers spotted something in the vicinity of our sun they couldn’t quite identify. They called it <em>Oumuamua</em>, and the way it moved suggested it wasn’t just an ordinary comet or asteroid. Harvard researchers now <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/scientists-say-mysterious-oumuamua-object-could-be-alien-spacecraft-ncna931381?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise the possibility</a> it “may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization.”</p>
