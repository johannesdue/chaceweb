<p>On Monday evening, a demonstration</p>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span>So, what happened in Chemnitz? </span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span> </span></div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span>Sunday night three German men are stabbed during a city festival, one of them dies. Two suspects arrested, of Syrian and Iraqi background. Circumstances unclear, police denying rumors about victims having tried to stop attackers from sexually harassing a woman. On Monday, AfD and local football ultras mobilize. At 3, AfD rally gathers 100 people and proceeds peacefully. Then, at 4, police decide to close down the ongoing city festival. The second rally, announced by "Kaotic Chemnitz" football ultras, begins at 4:30, gathering 800 people. Lots of festival-goers join in. Police unable to control the crowd, which breaks through the lines and marches on. Crowd grows to about 6000. Some 1500 counter-protesters show up. Police try to keep them separate, but at about 9 the situation deteriorates. Bottles and fireworks fly through the air, in some instances foreign-looking people are chased and attacked.</span></p>

</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span>A couple of thoughts:</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span> </span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span>1) Was it a "neo-Nazi mob"? Of course, there were violent Nazis there, and journalists love to focus on those (and they should). But many pictures, videos, and eyewitness accounts suggest lots of protesters were peaceful, "ordinary people". Even though militants use the crowd as a platform and cover for engaging in violence, it doesn't mean everyone in the crowd supports them.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span> </span></div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span>2) Don't dismiss legitimate concerns about immigration and crime as simply racism. While Chemnitz isn't particularly high-crime, local police stats suggest 1 in 4 crimes committed by foreigners/asylum seekers. Country-wide, police data suggest over-representation of asylum seekers on certain particularly serious (and far-right-mobilizing) types of violent crime. People with authoritarian predispositions will get fired up over this everywhere.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span> </span></div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span>3) Violence went both ways. DW: "As many as 18 protesters from both sides and two police officers were injured. Four far-right protesters were attacked and injured on their way home by a group of 15-20 people; two were hospitalized, police say."</span></div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span> </span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="">
<div class="_1mf _1mj"><span>4) Chemnitz is in East Germany, which carries a particular historical legacy of right-wing violence, which I wrote about here.</span></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>"The head of the police union GdP, Oliver Malchow, told German newspaper <em>Neue Osnabr√ºcker Zeitung</em> that police staff cuts in recent years were responsible for the lack of control over right-wing violence.</p>
<div>
<div>"The state has failed when is comes to domestic security because it massively reduced staff numbers," Malchow told the newspaper, adding that 20,000 new positions were required to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>Malchow pointed to a growing trend of vigilantism in Germany, and said: "When the state is perceived as no longer able to protect citizens, citizens take the law into their own hands and start to rely on self-defense militias and vigilantism.""</p>
