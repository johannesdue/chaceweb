<p>Onslaught on the Khabarovsk FSB offices in April last year, bordering on a suicide attack.</p>
<p>Talking to people about my research on the Russian extreme right, I often encounter the erroneous assumption that Putin and the extreme right are friends. To clear up this misunderstanding, it’s useful to distinguish between the imperial nationalists, who feel the Russian state should preside over a vast multi-ethnic empire like it has done historically, and the ethnonationalists, who feel Russia should be for ethnic Russians and want to limit the presence of non-Slavic people. While the imperially inclined nationalists often think well of Putin, most ethnonationalists see themselves as part of the opposition.</p>
<p>Among oppositional ethnonationalists, neo-Nazis and other racially oriented radicals most certainly despise the current regime. In my experience, their hatred of “the system” often comes across as the most intense of all. Consider this recent post from the <i>VKontakte</i> community <a href="https://vk.com/vntgwvs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Partizan_FM</a> (with some 9,000 followers), exhibiting some of the passion with which militant right-wingers frame their opposition to the regime. (See my translation below.)</p>

<p>We don’t want a maidan, moron, we want to burn you, strip 40 million of your little bitches in the whole country of their citizenship, and send them to North Korea, or home to HELL with gas chambers.</p>

<p>For all the intensity of their bark, however, there’s little political bite to the extreme right’s activism these days.</p>
<p>For one, the level of visible activism is down: while in the mid-to-late 00s right-wing militants killed hundreds of their “racial enemies” and political adversaries on the streets, for 2017 I have registered only a couple of deadly incidents. While the annual Russian March used to gather thousands of activists, the last one in November was fragmented and attended by just a few hundred. Leaders are in jail or have gone into exile.</p>
<p>Since 2014, the authorities have been gearing up repression against radical nationalists, particularly those who have taken a pro-Ukrainian stance.</p>
